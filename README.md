# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning classification techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographics and service usage patterns.

---

## 📌 Objective

To help companies proactively identify customers at risk of churning and design retention strategies. The model is built using classification algorithms and evaluated on key performance metrics.
